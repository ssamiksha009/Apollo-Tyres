# Apollo Tyres Dependency Resolution Fix - COMPLETED

## Problem Summary
The dependency resolution logic was not correctly mapping P_L values from the database to folder structure. When resolving job dependencies (e.g., Run 2 depends on "rollingtire_brake_trac" from Run 1), the system was finding multiple jobs with the same name across different folders but picking the wrong folder context.

## Root Cause
- Database contains multiple jobs with same name in different P_L folders (e.g., "rollingtire_brake_trac" exists in P1_L1, P2_L2, P2_L3, etc.)
- Original logic used multi-strategy priority system that could select jobs from ANY folder
- No enforcement that dependencies must be resolved within the same P_L context as the calling job

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Contextual Dependency Resolution
**File Modified**: `server.js` (lines ~1396-1430)

**Before**:
```javascript
// Searched across ALL folders for job name
let query = `SELECT p, l, job, old_job FROM ${tableName} WHERE job = $1`;
// Then used complex priority system to pick "best" match across folders
```

**After**:
```javascript
// ONLY search within caller's context
if (callerContext) {
    query = `SELECT p, l, job, old_job FROM ${tableName} WHERE job = $1 AND p = $2 AND l = $3`;
    queryParams = [jobName, callerContext.p, callerContext.l];
    console.log(`Searching for dependency job "${jobName}" ONLY in folder ${callerContext.p}_${callerContext.l}`);
}
```

### 2. Context Propagation
**File Modified**: `server.js` (line 1463)

**Before**:
```javascript
await resolveDependencies(jobData.old_job, visitedJobs, currentContext);
```

**After**:
```javascript
// Pass current job's context to dependency resolution
const currentContext = { p: jobData.p, l: jobData.l };
await resolveDependencies(jobData.old_job, visitedJobs, currentContext);
```

### 3. Initial Context Setup
**File Modified**: `server.js` (line 1565)

**Before**:
```javascript
await resolveDependencies(rowData.job, new Set());
```

**After**:
```javascript
// Pass initial job's context
const initialContext = { p: rowData.p, l: rowData.l };
await resolveDependencies(rowData.job, new Set(), initialContext);
```

## Verification Results

### ✅ Database Mapping Correct
- Database P_L values (`P1`, `L1`) correctly map to folder structure (`P1_L1`)
- No folder name construction issues

### ✅ Contextual Restriction Working
- Run 2 (P1_L1) looking for dependency "rollingtire_brake_trac"
- System correctly finds dependency ONLY in P1_L1 folder
- System ignores same-named jobs in P2_L2, P2_L3, etc.

### ✅ Dependency Chain Preserved
- Recursive dependency calls maintain context correctly
- Each job's dependencies resolved within its own P_L folder

### ✅ ODB File Detection
- System correctly finds existing ODB files in proper context
- Path: `D:\Apollo-Tyres\abaqus\ac_MF62\P1_L1\rollingtire_brake_trac.odb`

## Test Cases Validated

1. **test_pl_mapping.js**: Verified P_L folder mapping logic
2. **test_complete_fix.js**: Comprehensive end-to-end validation  
3. **test_context_restriction.js**: Confirmed no cross-folder switching
4. **check_job_locations.js**: Database structure verification

## Final Status: ✅ FIXED

The Apollo Tyres dependency resolution system now correctly:
- Maps P_L values from database to folder structure
- Restricts dependency resolution to same P_L context
- Prevents cross-folder dependency switching
- Maintains proper execution context throughout dependency chains

**No further work needed on P_L mapping logic.**
